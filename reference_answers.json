    "document_summary" : "The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath and fatigue, with elevated inflammatory markers (CRP: 38 mg/L). Imaging ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed mild bronchial thickening. No fever was present, and oxygen levels remained stable. Cardiology was consulted due to family history, but ECG and troponin were non-concerning. The patient was treated conservatively with fluids and observation. No antibiotics were given due to lack of infection. She was discharged in stable condition with outpatient follow-ups and guidance on warning signs."
    "medical_Q/A" : "A high CRP (C-reactive protein) level means there is inflammation in your body. It doesnâ€™t point to a specific disease, but itâ€™s often elevated in infections, autoimmune conditions, or chronic illnesses like heart disease.

While a mildly elevated CRP may not be serious, significantly high levels can suggest an active infection or flare-up of a condition. Your doctor will interpret it alongside your symptoms and other test results.

ðŸ‘‰ So yes, itâ€™s worth monitoring â€” but itâ€™s not always something to worry about on its own.

"Interpretation" : "The patient reports having a sore throat for three days, along with mild fever and painful swallowing. Based on these symptoms, the doctor suspects pharyngitis (throat infection). The recommended treatment is a 5-day course of antibiotics, along with rest and adequate fluid intake."
