    ü©∫ **What is this project?**  
    This is an AI-powered chatbot designed to help patients understand complex medical documents, ask health-related questions, and interpret conversations with their doctors ‚Äî even audio recordings.

    üí° **Why it matters**  
    Patients are often overwhelmed by medical jargon. This tool makes that information **clear, concise, and accessible** using cutting-edge AI models fine-tuned for real healthcare use cases.

    üîí **Can you trust it?**  
    Yes. We built this system using:
    - Open-source models specialized for medicine
    - Post-processing filters to avoid hallucinated (fake) facts
    - Benchmarks against ChatGPT on 200+ medical questions
    - Usability and trust evaluation using the QUEST framework

    ‚ö° **How fast is it?**  
    Most responses are returned in **under 1 minute** with high accuracy and readability.

    üß† Built with: `MedQ-Llama3`, `MedSumm-BART`, `ConvInt-BART + Whisper`

    The patient was admitted for evaluation of shortness of breath, fatigue, and elevated inflammatory markers. Notably, her CRP level was measured at 38 mg/L. A CT scan of the chest was unremarkable for pulmonary embolism, but mild bronchial thickening was observed. She was afebrile throughout her stay, and oxygen saturation remained above 96% on room air. Cardiology was consulted due to a family history of coronary artery disease. The ECG showed non-specific ST changes, but troponin levels remained within normal range.

    The patient was managed conservatively with hydration, monitoring, and supportive care. No antibiotics were administered due to the absence of clear infectious etiology. She was discharged in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled with pulmonology and cardiology. Patient education included red flag signs and when to return to the ED.
